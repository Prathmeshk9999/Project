          Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India. 
He is considered to be one of the greatest warriors of his time and even today, stories 
of his exploits are narrated as a part of the folklore. With his valor and great administrative 
skills, Shivaji carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. It 
eventually became the genesis of the Maratha Empire. After establishing his rule, Shivaji 
implemented a competent and progressive administration with the help of a disciplined 
military and well-established administrative set-up. Shivaji is well-known for his innovative 
military tactics that centered around non-conventional methods leveraging strategic factors 
like geography, speed, and surprise to defeat his more powerful enemies.

<h2><b>Childhood & Early Life</b></h2>

     Shivaji Bhosle was born on February 19, 1630 to Shahaji Bhosle and Jijabai in the fort of Shivneri, 
near the city of Junnar of the Pune district. Shivaji’s father Shahaji was in service of the Bijapuri 
Sultanate - a tripartite association between Bijapur, Ahmednagar, and Golconda, as a general. 
He also owned a Jaigirdari near Pune. Shivaji’s mother Jijabai was the daughter of Sindkhed leader 
Lakhujirao Jadhav and a deeply religious woman. Shivaji was especially close to his mother who 
instilled in him a strict sense of right and wrong. Since Shahaji spent most of his time outside of 
Pune, the responsibility of overseeing Shivaji’s education rested on the shoulders of a small council 
of ministers which included a Peshwa (Shamrao Nilkanth),a Mazumdar (Balkrishna Pant), a Sabnis 
(Raghunath Ballal), a Dabir (Sonopant) and a chief teacher (Dadoji Konddeo). Kanhoji Jedhe and Baji 
Pasalkar were appointed to train Shivaji in military and martial arts. Shivaji was married to Saibai 
Nimbalkar in 1640.Shivaji turned out to be a born leader from a very young age. An active outdoorsman,
 he explored the Sahayadri Mountains surrounding the Shivneri forts and came to know the area like the 
back of his hands. By the time he was 15, he had accumulated a band of faithful soldiers from the Maval 
region who later aided in his early conquests.

<h2><b>Struggles with Bijapur</b></h2>

          By 1645, Shivaji acquired control of several strategic from under the Bijapur Sultanate around Pune – Torna 
from Inayat Khan, Chakan from FirangojiNarsala, Kondana from Adil Shahi Governor, along with Singhagarh 
and Purandar. Following his success, he had emerged as a threat for Mohammed Adil Shah who gave the order 
to imprison Shahaji in 1648. Shahaji was released on condition that Shivaji kept a low profile and kept from 
further conquests. Shivaji resumed his conquests after Shahaji’s death in 1665 by acquiring the valley of Javali 
from Chandrarao More, a Bijapuri jaigirdaar. Mohammed Adil Shah sent Afzal Khan, a powerful general in his 
employ to subdue Shivaji.

<h2><b>Conflicts with the Mughals</b></h2>

        Shivaji’s conflicts with the Bijapuri Sultanate and his continuous victories brought him under the radar of Mughal
Emperor Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb saw him as a threat to expansion of his imperial intent and concentrated his efforts 
on eradicating the Maratha threat. Confrontations began in 1957, when Shivaji’s generals raided and looted Mughal 
territories near Ahmednagar and Junnar. However, Aurangzeb’s retaliation was thwarted by arrival of rainy season 
and battle for succession back in Delhi. Aurangzeb directed Shaista Khan, Governor of Deccan and his maternal uncle, 
to subdue Shivaji. Shaista Khan launched a massive attack against Shivaji, capturing several forts under his control and 
even his capital Poona. Shivaji retaliated back by launching a stealth attack on Shaista Khan, eventually injuring him and 
evicting him from Poona. Shaista Khan later arranged multiple attacks on Shivaji, severely reducing his holds of forts in the 
Konkan region. To replenish his depleted treasury, Shivaji attacked Surat, an important Mughal trading center and looted the 
Mughal wealth. An infuriated Aurangzeb sent his chief general Jai Singh I with an army of 150,000. The Mughal forces made 
considerable dent, sieging forts under Shivaji’s control, extracting money and slaughtering soldiers in their wake. Shivaji agreed 
to come to an agreement with Aurangzeb to prevent further loss of life and the Treaty of Purandar was signed between Shivaji 
and Jai Singh on June 11, 1665. Shivaji agreed to surrender 23 forts and pay a sum of 400000 as compensation to the Mughal Empire.
 Aurangzeb invited Shivaji to Agra with an aim to use his military prowess to consolidate Mughal empires in Afghanistan. 
Shivaji travelled to Agra with his eight year old son Sambhaji and was offended by Aurangzeb’s treatment of him. He stormed 
out of the court and an offended Aurangzeb placed him under house arrest. But Shivaji once again used his wit and cunning to 
escape the imprisonment. He feigned severe illness and arranged for baskets of sweets to be sent to temple as offerings for prayer.
 He disguised as one of the carriers and hid his son in one of the baskets, and escaped on August 17, 1666. In subsequent times, 
Mughal and Maratha hostilities were pacified to a large extent by constant mediation through Mughal Sardar Jaswant Singh. 
Peace lasted till 1670, after which Shivaji launched an all-out offense against the Mughals. He recovered most of his territories 
sieged by the Mughals within four months.
